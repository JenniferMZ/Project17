Making a Binary Quiz Game

This program randomly generates a number and displays it through the LEDs in binary. It then prompts the user to enter that number in base 10, confirms the input and checks it against the randomly generated number and declares the answer either correct or incorrect, with the correct binary and base 10 number as an explanation.
